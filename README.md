Crypto Cesar

* Crypto Cesar is a offset encryption, we call this encryption "Cesar Encryption" because Cesar itself use them to pass messages in wartime. This allowed him to create message that no 
one can understand except the receiver because he know the shift (offset).

* This program is juste a training for me, I have done this program after a challenge on root-me.

How to use it ?

It is simple you have just to put your string when the program ask you and after that you can two possibility, bruteforce to check all the shift between 1 to 25 or if you know the shift
you can use one that you know like 5.
